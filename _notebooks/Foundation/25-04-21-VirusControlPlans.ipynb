    "## Concept Overview:\n",
    "In this game, players take on the role of a virus containment specialist tasked with controlling and managing the spread of a dangerous virus. Using biotechnology tools and genetic engineering, players will have to develop strategies to limit the virus’s transmission, create vaccines, and find cures. The game challenges players to think critically about how viruses mutate, spread, and how to mitigate their effects on global populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Game Features & Mechanics:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "- Contain and control the virus's spread by modifying its genetic makeup, developing cures, or implementing containment strategies.\n",
    "- Analyze the outcome and adjust future strategies based on the feedback and mutation of the virus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Virus Control Mechanics:\n",
    "- Players select from various control strategies, including quarantine zones, genetic modifications to reduce transmission, or creating immunity in populations.\n",
    "- Each virus mutation adds new challenges and factors to consider, such as increased resistance to vaccines or spread through the air.\n",
    "- Players can also develop a virus antidote or vaccine by sequencing its DNA and understanding how to disrupt its replication process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Virus Mutation & Spread:\n",
    "- The virus continuously mutates, becoming resistant to previously deployed measures, forcing players to adapt their strategy.\n",
    "- Players must balance between controlling the virus, minimizing fatalities, and creating a sustainable long-term solution.\n",
    "- Mutations will vary, with some making the virus more dangerous, while others might help the virus spread more easily or evade medical treatments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resource Management:\n",
    "- Players are given limited resources to develop cures, vaccines, and containment measures (e.g., Gene Points, funding, medical staff).\n",
    "- High-level solutions (e.g., global vaccination campaigns, viral mutations) are expensive and require strategic planning and resource allocation.\n",
    "- Players must manage these resources to keep the population safe while also containing the virus.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dynamic Environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of a simple progression, the virus control strategies must adapt to changing situations around the globe. Below are examples of situations that can affect virus containment strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Urban Outbreak**\n",
    "- **Challenges:** High population density, rapid spread, and lack of medical infrastructure.\n",
    "- **Control Strategies:**\n",
    "  - Quarantine: Isolate infected zones to stop spread.\n",
    "  - Social Distancing: Introduce lockdowns to limit exposure.\n",
    "  - Medical Research: Speed up vaccine development or virus eradication strategies.\n",
    "- **Strategy:** Balancing immediate containment (quarantine) with long-term prevention (vaccine development) is essential in urban environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Rural Outbreak**\n",
    "- **Challenges:** Limited healthcare resources, low population density, and delayed virus spread.\n",
    "- **Control Strategies:**\n",
    "  - Vaccine Distribution: Focus on preventing outbreaks before they spread.\n",
    "  - Mobile Clinics: Bring medical support to rural communities.\n",
    "  - Community Engagement: Educate the public on prevention measures.\n",
    "- **Strategy:** While the virus spreads slower, limited resources and access to medical care will be a major challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Global Pandemic**\n",
    "- **Challenges:** Worldwide virus spread, varying governmental responses, and differing healthcare systems.\n",
    "- **Control Strategies:**\n",
    "  - International Collaboration: Coordinate efforts between countries for better containment and resource sharing.\n",
    "  - Public Health Campaigns: Create global awareness campaigns for preventative measures like vaccination and hygiene.\n",
    "  - Mutations: Deal with evolving strains that are resistant to initial cures.\n",
    "- **Strategy:** The player must manage a global response, ensuring international cooperation and managing multiple mutations and variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Viral Mutation**\n",
    "- **Challenges:** New strains of the virus emerge, with altered transmission rates, symptoms, and resistance to existing vaccines or cures.\n",
    "- **Control Strategies:**\n",
    "  - Genetic Engineering: Edit the virus’s genes to make it less harmful or more predictable.\n",
    "  - Rapid Research: Accelerate the research into cures to match the virus’s mutation rate.\n",
    "  - Immune Boosting: Modify populations genetically to become immune to the virus.\n",
    "- **Strategy:** Mutations require immediate research and adaptations to existing treatments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Educational Focus:\n",
    "- **Virus Mutation & Spread:** Teaches players how viruses mutate over time and how this influences containment strategies.\n",
    "- **Genetic Engineering:** Introduces players to the concept of gene editing and how genetic changes can help control or eradicate diseases.\n",
    "- **Public Health Strategies:** Helps players understand the real-world strategies used in virus containment and epidemic management.\n",
    "- **Resource Allocation:** Encourages critical thinking in balancing resources for research, treatment, and containment efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mutation Tracker:** Track how the virus mutates over time, including resistance to treatments, transmission rates, and severity of symptoms.\n",
    "- **Global Network:** Coordinate with other in-game countries or regions to combat a global outbreak.\n",
    "- **Research & Development:** Continuously develop new treatments, vaccines, and diagnostic tools to combat new strains of the virus.\n",
    "- **Outbreak Scenarios:** Random global outbreaks with specific challenges, such as political unrest or healthcare system collapses, that make the virus harder to control.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Virus Control - Burndown Checklist:\n",
