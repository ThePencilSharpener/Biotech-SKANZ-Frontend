    "# Biotech Innovation Engagement Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ideation\n",
    "The Scripps Research Biotech Innovation Engagement project aims to increase public awareness of Scripps Research's biotech advancements through an online game. By integrating machine learning and data analysis, we plan to create an experience that educates social media followers on biotech concepts. The project aligns with Scripps Research’s mission to promote scientific literacy and encourage interest in biotechnology among the public.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why it interests us\n",
    "This project is exciting because it blends interactive technology, biotech education, and social media engagement. Many people are unaware of the latest innovations in biotech, and through this game, we can make complex topics accessible and engaging. Our goal is to increase engagement by 30% within three months, ensuring that more people interact with and understand the impact of biotech research. The initiative also demonstrates how gamification and data-driven insights can enhance science communication.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sets\n",
    "The project will utilize biotech research data from Scripps Research publications, public databases, and other reports. Team members will analyze these datasets to extract Scripps's biotech breakthroughs. Machine learning tinkers, such as adaptive and repetitive question generation, will be explored to improve engagement and knowledge retention.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example Dataset: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/biotechnology-regulatory-services-public-data-file-permits-notifications-and-petitions\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset provides data on Biotechnology Regulatory Services. This shows which hospitals have licenses and services to do Biotechnological research and care. Along with the type of license.\n",
